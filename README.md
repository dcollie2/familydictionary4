This app supports [An Abbreviated Family Dictionary](https://familydictionary.net), a poetry project which takes idiosyncratic definitions of words 
drawn from childhood memories and presents those in the form of a dictionary. For each definition, any words 
that are defined elsewhere in the dictionary are linked to those definitions. It also provides links to the word's 
definition in other online dictionaries and a pull of the most recent photos returned by a Flickr search for 
the defined word.

Words are navigable in the order they were originally added. They are also navigable by their connections; a
given word is linked to the definitions that use it and to the words that it uses in its definition.

With the exception of some idiosyncratic labeling and humor, this could be used to build an actual dictionary
which provided all of these resources for words and allowed for this "defined by or used in" web of connections
among the words and definitions. If anyone ever does this, I will be quite surprised.

It also includes basic page creation to support adding other content. Again, there are a few quirky
uses of this which are specific to this application.

This is a from-scratch rewrite of the original project. I did this as a learning exercise and am keeping it public because
why not?
