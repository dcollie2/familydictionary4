9,poems-bed,Bed,"<p>Warm feathers over air and sponge<br />flesh, nature&rsquo;s comfort: a live bed<br />eats the pea that would purple the<br />princess, and from five hundred fowl<br />one claw pokes up to scratch the fat<br />prince from twitchy sleep into dreams<br />of smooth seas as the flock walks out,<br />carries them from their room, from her<br />father&rsquo;s castle and kingdom through<br />foreign lands until desert, beach<br />or our moon&rsquo;s pale shell curves away<br />beneath them as they wake, startled<br />and naked before one thousand<br />exhausted, inquisitive eyes.</p>

10,poems-factory,Factory,"<p>The hearts have again begun to beat, and the livers and gizzards pulse with mysterious labors. The hearts, laid in lines on conveyor belts, beat maybe for love, maybe for loneliness, beat a drumbeat summons to scattered pieces, beat to surround themselves again with warm chicken.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s young. She&rsquo;s afraid. She&rsquo;s new to the line. She pictures zombie chickens dripping salmonella who cluck onto her chest and peck tiny holes in her crisp outer coating, then peel it back to expose the veiny granny cowering beneath.</p>
<p>The hearts stop beating but she&rsquo;s hopeless. She&rsquo;s stymied. This happens sometimes. There are procedures. They take her off the line, take her into a pale green office which smells of bleach. Since it&rsquo;s her first time, she gets the film. They start the machine, dim the lights and leave her alone with the projector&rsquo;s click and the bright image of a beautiful woman wearing the standard silver hairnet and liver-red lipstick. The image says,</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 2em; font-style: italic;""><em>It&rsquo;s ok. It happens sometimes. There are irregularities. Things get different. Sometimes we gut a thousand chickens but end up with 1,001 hearts. Sometimes a worker climbs on the line and rides through the factory, silent in fantasy, covered in entrails. Once a woman took a carcass as her lover and hid in a closet, madly fisting its body cavity and whispering secrets into its neck. It&rsquo;s ok. These are just variations, the bird with the extra head, the occasional unbreakable egg.</em></p>
<p>The film continues to roll out comfort. Her thighs quiver, legs tense, breasts tighten. She begins to cry.</p>

11,poems-description,Description of the Cock,"<p>Some people think it is a cross<br />between a chicken and a turkey.</p>
<p>Simple, straight, it rises<br />from the front to the back.<br />It is precisely toothed behind<br />a tassel of thin tufts,<br />very small and intensely red.</p>
<p>The face should be red; if it is white<br />it is considered a deficiency.<br />Wide, a bit embossed and deep,<br />the body seems stocky<br />due to the crammed belly<br />and the back slightly inclines.</p>
<p>It is long and wide.<br />The cock's dark red, close<br />on the body, upside turned,<br />nicely curved<br />in the form of a sickle.</p>
<p>High, not steep, it emerges<br />from the body<br />at a blunt angle.</p>
<p>Easily scared by strangers<br />but tame with those who tend<br />them, a grown-up cock<br />has a small, fine-shaped head,<br />short, rimmed with horn-color.</p>
<p>The red eyes give an impression of ardor.</p>

12,poems-illustrations,Illustrations Omitted from Sections One Through Five,"<p>1.</p>
<p>The parrot who pretends to be a chicken does not neglect to talk. Is this a lapse from character?</p>
<p>This chicken is overly self-critical. It perceives feather stubble beneath its plastic when no such stubble exists.</p>
<p>The identically-bearded depressives I sent to my ex-therapist, now boiled and dyed and safe in their carton.</p>
<p>He smashed the eggs all on their crates. With a tiny chrome hammer like this one. And one finger. And one thumb.</p>
<p>Human fingers arranged for flight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>How many lumps in this innocent viper?</p>
<p>Stale white bread cut into squares and steeped in urine. Good, sweet butter as big as your fist. A fighter's supper.</p>
<p>Tempered silver fighting spurs passed father to son, hand to bloody hand.</p>
<p>At the fairground, the tic-tac-toe chicken scratches multiples on the sly like a Japanese schoolchild.</p>
<p>A henhouse built on monopiles deep in the ocean floor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Now that we've pruned the farmer's hands, who will caress our feathered buttocks?</p>
<p>The actual hardboiled egg from that urban legend.</p>
<p>The chicken gun. A marvel of engineering, which is a subset of science, to which we turn when we want to understand our world. I am not perverse enough to make this shit up.</p>
<p>So much trouble from a transient swan boner.</p>
<p>Every chicken you ever ate. Just standing and staring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>The bully on his huffy seeks revenge. Who egged his girlfriend's tire in a spray of dry salad? Who asked this peach fuzz blonde to kick some ass?</p>
<p>The Devil Bird, La Fl&egrave;che, hippest of all domesticated evils.</p>
<p>A still from Hitchcock's unfinished film about his fear of hens. Note the laying beds enclosing the protagonist like a hay-strewn amphitheater, the discreet cameo of the Master's nested head.</p>
<p>Yolk stains on a grey lapel.</p>
<p>The chicken and the egg. Coming simultaneously, dear Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>What is the kosher status of this Muscovy duck?</p>
<p>A correct way to stack chickens. The correct way to stack chickens.</p>
<p>Fidgety hens hatch healthy eggs.</p>
<p>A squab in the hands of a scurvy squab.</p>
<p>A golem of yellow hatchlings strangles its maker with one peeping hand.</p>

13,poems-culled,Culled from the Clutch,"<p>I will work towards an arbitrary round count of recurrences of the word ""chicken"".</p>
<p>Body parts replaced with whole chickens.</p>
<p>Chickens as stomachs with legs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chickens as escapees from your gut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your gut as a chicken-shaped wound.</p>
<p>The cowardly general's poultry epaulettes. Stomping his live chicken shoes.</p>
<p>A nut punch with a chicken glove. The way the glove squawks your name.</p>
<p>We are named for how we will be served.</p>
<p>Jonah pining in the dark of a chicken.</p>
<p>Ahab stunned by barnyard abundance.</p>
<p>Mary, feathered in blue, espousing a new form of virginity.</p>
<p>We rub hens together in continuance of our species.</p>
<p>Cold-blooded chickens toasting our eggs on rocks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rare mammal chicken nursing her young.</p>
